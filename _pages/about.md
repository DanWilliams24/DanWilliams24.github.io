I'm Daniel, a first-year PhD student at Princeton University and I study how we can use machine learning to design clean energy systems. Working with Dr. Ryan Adams and Dr. Egemen Kolemen, I conduct research between the Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems (LIPS) and the Plasma Control Laboratory. I recently completed my BS in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) as a Meyerhoff Scholar.

My research background is in the energy sector. During Summer 2024, I studied Large Language Models (LLMs) and GraphRAG to help maintain aging hydroelectric infrastructure. Previously, I conducted research in nuclear fusion at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) focusing on stellarator design, and in nuclear fission at MIT working on AI-based surrogate models for reactor core optimization. I have also published research on ethical hacking at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

As a PhD student, my research spans problems in high dimensional optimization, inverse design and electromagnetics, notably aiming to develop novel algorithms for nuclear fusion reactor design. I aim to work at the intersection of research and industry, where I can translate novel algorithms into real-world impact while promoting science literacy and diversity in STEM.

Welcome to my personal website. Here, you can find details about who I am and what I do. I have gained experience in a variety of different scientific fields, coding languages, and technologies, while also trying to do some good in the world along the way.

**ðŸ”­ I am looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2024. Please feel free to reach out with opportunities you believe I'd be a good fit for!**
