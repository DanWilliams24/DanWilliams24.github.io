Hi, My name is Daniel. I am a highly motivated senior undergraduate majoring in computer science with a focus on AI/ML at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. My research interests lie in utilizing AI to tackle challenges in physics and clean energy.

I have a strong research background in nuclear energy, previously conducting award-winning fusion and fission research at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and Massachusetts Institute Of Technology (MIT) respectively. Additionally, I have published research on ethical hacking during my time at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

In the future, I hope to earn a Ph.D. applying Artificial Intelligence to optimize existing sustainable energy options and enable future carbon-free energy sources. I also seek to become a professor, advocating for diversity and science literacy in local communities.

Welcome to my personal website. Here, you can find details about who I am and what I do. I have gained experience in a variety of different languages, platforms, and technologies, while also trying to do some good in the world along the way.


**ðŸ”­ I am looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2024. Please feel free to reach out with opportunities you believe I'd be a good fit for!**
