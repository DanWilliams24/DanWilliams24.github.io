Hi, My name is Daniel. I am a PhD student at Princeton and current GEM Fellow working on using machine learning to tackle challenges in physics and clean energy, co-advised by Dr. Ryan Adams and Dr. Egemen Kolemen at the Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems (LIPS) and Plasma Control Laboratory. In 2024, I completed my BS in Computer Science (2024) at the University of Maryland, Batimore County (UMBC) as a Meyerhoff Scholar.

My research background is in the energy sector. During Summer 2024, I conducted Large Language model (LLM+RAG) research to help maintain aging hydro-electric plants at Oakridge National Laboratory. I have also previously conducted award-winning fusion and fission research at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and Massachusetts Institute Of Technology (MIT) respectively. Additionally, I have published research on ethical hacking during my time at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

As a PhD student, I hope to earn a Ph.D. applying Artificial Intelligence to optimize existing sustainable energy options and enable future carbon-free energy sources. I also seek to become a professor, advocating for diversity and science literacy in local communities.

Welcome to my personal website. Here, you can find details about who I am and what I do. I have gained experience in a variety of different languages, platforms, and technologies, while also trying to do some good in the world along the way.

**ðŸ”­ I am looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2024. Please feel free to reach out with opportunities you believe I'd be a good fit for!**
