I'm Daniel, a first-year PhD student at Princeton University and I study how we can use machine learning to design clean energy systems. Working with Dr. Ryan Adams and Dr. Egemen Kolemen, I conduct research between the Laboratory for Intelligent Probabilistic Systems (LIPS) and the Plasma Control Laboratory. I recently completed my BS in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) as a Meyerhoff Scholar.

As a PhD student, my research spans problems in optimization, inverse design and electromagnetics, notably aiming to develop novel algorithms for nuclear fusion reactor design. I aim to work at the intersection of research and industry, and promote science literacy and diversity in STEM.

Welcome to my personal website. Here, you can find details about who I am and what I do. I have gained experience in a variety of different scientific fields, coding languages, and technologies, while also trying to do some good in the world along the way.
