My research background is in the energy sector. During Summer 2024 at Oakridge National Laboratory, I studied Large Language Models and GraphRAG to help maintain aging hydroelectric infrastructure. Previously, I conducted research in nuclear fusion at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory focusing on stellarator design, and in nuclear fission at MIT working on AI-based surrogate models for reactor core optimization. I have also published research on ethical hacking at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

I seek to build a career developing complex decision making systems that are of particular benefit to society, science and engineering. Here is some of what I've built in my free time:

### Social Impact
* **Mediconnect**: UMD Grant funded SMS Chat Bot to connect injured protesters to medical help during BLM Protests.
* **LivEco**: Mobile image classifier app for the identifying and understanding different forms of recyclables.
* **MCPSClassroomHelper**: Using APIs and Node.js to help MCPS school district students manage online coursework.

### AI + Machine Learning
* **COVID-19 Risk Data Analytics**: [Using Random Forest and SVMs to classify COVID Risk by U.S County.](/projects/covid19)
* **NLP Sentiment Analysis**: Using TF-IDF analysis and classifiers for effective movie review sentiment prediciton.  
* **DanCV**: OpenCV Object Detection for Autonomous Robot Pathfinding & Obstacle Avoidance

### Mobile App Development (iOS + Android)
* **NuCare**: Simple Nuclear medicine and radiation treatment information for patients and families.
* **MCPSClassroomHelper Mobile**: iOS + Android companion app to developed website for helping students organize their schoolwork.  
* **Star Sentry**: An old school arcade space shooter game for iOS devices.
