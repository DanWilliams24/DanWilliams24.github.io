<b>My name is Daniel Williams, I am a highly motivated senior undergraduate majoring in computer science with a focus on AI/ML at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, graduating in Spring 2024.</b>My research interests lie in utilizing AI to tackle challenges in physics and clean energy. I have a strong research background in nuclear energy, previously conducting award-winning fusion and fission research at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and Massachusetts Institute Of Technology (MIT) respectively. Additionally, I have published research on ethical hacking during my time at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. In the future, I hope to earn a Ph.D. applying Artificial Intelligence to optimize existing sustainable energy options and enable fusion energy as a carbon-free energy source. I also seek to become a professor, advocating for diversity and science literacy in local communities.
