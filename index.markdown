Welcome to my personal website. Here you can find a detailed record of my projects conducted over the years. I have gained experience in a variety of different languages, platforms, and technologies, while also trying to do some good in the world along the way. **I am actively looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2022**. Please feel free to reach out with opportunities you believe I'd be a good fit for!
