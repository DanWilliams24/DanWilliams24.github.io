Thus far, I have conducted research at UMBC with a professor, and at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory as a part of the [CIRCUIT program](https://www.jhuapl.edu/circuit/). Since this summer, I have been conducting research at MIT in [MSRP](https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/#:~:text=The%20MIT%20Summer%20Research%20Program,for%20graduate%20education%20at%20MIT.), specifically at the intersection of AI and Nuclear Energy. My current research interests span **AI/ML, nuclear engineering, optimization, and novel deep learning methodologies**. In the future, I plan to earn a Ph.D. in computer science furthering and contributing to scientific progress through research.
