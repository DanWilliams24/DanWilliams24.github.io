# My Research Journey

I have spent undergrad exploring various research interests, particularly in the intersections between artificial intelligence, machine learning, physics, and energy. Thus far, I have conducted research at UMBC with a professor, at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory as a part of the CIRCUIT program, at MIT as a scholar in MSRP program, and most recently at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory as a DOE SULI Intern.

### At the Forefront of Nuclear Fusion and Fission

#### Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL)
In my current role at PPPL, I am delving into the complexities of nuclear fusion. My work involves developing a global search framework to optimize stellarators, an innovative approach to safer and more efficient nuclear fusion.

#### Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
At MIT, I ventured into the realm of nuclear fission. Here, I developed deep learning models to enhance the design of nuclear reactors, contributing to advancements in energy efficiency and safety.

### The Intersection of AI and Cybersecurity

#### Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL)
My time at JHU APL was dedicated to uncovering vulnerabilities in AI/ML supply chains within self-driving vehicles, enabling better risk assessment tools to ensure the safety of vehicles on the road.

#### University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)
At UMBC, I explored the use of reinforcement learning for static malware detection, supporting ongoing efforts to protect digital systems from increasingly sophisticated malware attacks.

# Reflecting on My Path

This journey has been both challenging and exhilarating. Each experience has enriched my understanding and propelled me toward my ultimate goal: pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science, where I aim to further contribute to scientific progress through cutting-edge research.

### Future Aspirations
As I look forward to a Ph.D., I am excited about the opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities of AI, ML, and clean energy technologies. My goal is to emerge as a contributor to transformative technologies that support an equitable future with a particular emphasis on supporting marginalized peoples.
