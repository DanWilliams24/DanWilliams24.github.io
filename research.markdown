Thus far, I have conducted research at UMBC with a professor, and at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory as a part of the [CIRCUIT program](https://www.jhuapl.edu/circuit/). This summer, I will be conducting research at MIT, specifically at the intersection of AI and Nuclear Energy. My current research interests include **AI/ML, Evolutionary Computing, Cybersecurity, and Beyond-Moore Computing Paradigms**. In the future, I hope to earn a Ph.D. in computer science furthering and contributing to scientific progress through research.
